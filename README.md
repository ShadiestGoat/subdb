# SubDB

Substitutable DB is a very serious & very important project. It makes databases good.

## No Bloat

- No CRUD (Updates are bloat, you don't need them) (under consideration, perhaps we could allow this?)
- No "query language" (cmon, you REALLY dont need this)
- No forced backend (you can pick the way you want to store things)

## Very fast

Its like sonic, but faster

## Substitutable

You can change backends (very cool) to ones that you see fit. Cache, cloud, permanent storage, etc. All very cool stuff.

## Made by hot people (person)

You can rest assured that this database is made & managed for exclusively hot people

## Production Ready

No god no I pray to our great lord Xenu that this never hits a real production environment

## Open source

Unlike the rest of them. No other database is open source. Don't fact check this.

## Founded by a hot person

Unlike the other databases, you can rest assured that this database was created by a hot person. If you don't trust some README.md file to confirm this, look at these real testimonies by real people:

- Shes very hot
- The creator of SDB is very hot
- The creator of SDB is so hot I want to give her money on https://donate.shadygoat.eu
- I want to send the creator of SDB salad, which I only do to hot people

## Hey, at least its not a csv database

This database & the backends provided but not forced by default is mildly better than a csv database

## Used by hot people

Only hot people are allowed to use, contribute or even see this code. If you're not hot, please do not look at the code.

## It stores things

Yep this database sure does store things... Even between restarts which is pretty cool

## Sub stands for substitutable

Thats what it stands for. Trust me. Its because you can sub the backends. For example, I can sub my backend to a harder and/or larger storage method.
